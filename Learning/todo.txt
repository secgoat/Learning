 BUG FIX:

ENHNACEMENTS:

 Keep track of places of items in the level.txt file, make a temporary level.tmp.txt and move stuff acordingly
 that will allow me to look one position up down left right easier for things like moving walls. ( does this need ot be done?)

 ?Make subsurface of main surface, blit everything to subsurface, copy subsurface, blit copy to main surface.
 had to revert and lost all those changes, hope I can do it again.?
 
 add the 32x32 tiles and figure out how to scroll map
 
        

DONE:


  Lava: remove 10 gems and the lava square, Lava expands (need to add timer and triggers done and done)
  
 3. colleciton of K R O Z letters ( letters added need to make sure they are collected in order, then add 10,000 points for it)
  - list to show which order letters were collected in
  -add 10k points if collected correctly


 make mobs break or remove items when stepping on them 
 
 Whip Power Ring 
 
 the ? (pouch + 25 gems)
 
 
  
 Play again y/n?
 this should reset everything if Y, and end game if N

 9. moving walls
  -get player position
  - get floor spaces near player
  -move walls in (possibly treat them like creatures and move them in a certain radius toward the player.)
