TODO:

 Keep track of places of items in the level.txt file, make a temporary level.tmp.txt and move stuff acordingly
 that will allow me to look one position up down left right easier for things like moving walls. ( does this need ot be done?)

 2. Make mobs less sensitive to player, only move when in same room, or on trigger spaces

 3. colleciton of K R O Z letters ( letters added need to make sure they are collected in order, then add 10,000 points for it)
  - list to show which order letters were collected in
  -add 10k points if collected correctly


 10. Bomb
  - art (cleanup)
  -trigger (done)
  -get breakable walls / items in radius (cleanup)
  -destroy all items / breakables in radius (doublecheck)
  -animation 
  
 
 12. ancient tablets

 13. the randomly generated levels

 14. figure out the differences between mobs, so far i have 3 timers set up, need to at least make them move at different speeds


 16. sound

 17. splash / animation screens
        title
        death (kind of)
        pit (kind of)
        highscore
 
CLEANUP:

 Lava: remove 10 gems and the lava square, Lava expands (need to add timer and triggers)

ENHNACEMENTS:

 
 Make subsurface of main surface, blit everything to subsurface, copy subsurface, blit copy to main surface.
 had to revert and lost all those changes, hope I can do it again.
 
 add the 32x32 tiles and figure out how to scroll map
 
        

DONE:

 make mobs break or remove items when stepping on them 
 
 Whip Power Ring 
 
 the ? (pouch + 25 gems)
 
 
  
 Play again y/n?
 this should reset everything if Y, and end game if N

 9. moving walls
  -get player position
  - get floor spaces near player
  -move walls in (possibly treat them like creatures and move them in a certain radius toward the player.)
